           for the Science of Discworld series of books.
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children
          TL;DR -> it's a statement which is truthy enough to get the point across
          without having to go into the extreme detail.

          ball which is being smushed at the top and bottom

      #‚ö†Ô∏è What is Empthy?
      - Four qualities
      - Feeling *WITH NOT FOR* people
      <!--
        four qualities: perspective taking, no judgement, recognising emotion,
        and communicating that you can recognise where they are at

      # What Empathy Is
      <img src="./img/not-alone.jpg">

      # ‚ö†Ô∏è What Empathy is Not?
      - Sympathy
      - Pity or Sorrow
      - Knowing without caring
      <!--
           - pity is acknowledging someone's pain, but not doing anything
              else
           - sympathy is displaying pity and hoping that the person's
              suffering will go away; putting yourself in their shoes
      -->

      # üí¨ Sympathy vs Empathy
        sympathy turns out to be less powerful than empathy
      - Scott Hershovitz (Nasty, Brutish, and Short)

      # ‚ö†Ô∏è Empathy is Caring
      - Caring
      - Understanding the struggle

      # üí≠ What Compassion is
        // Seeking a solution
        compassion = (empathy or sympathy) and desire_to_relieve_suffering
      Medical professionals do this all the time
      (they take the `empathy and desire_to_relieve_suffering` path)
      
      # üí≠Why Do We Need This?
        Your code is making somebody cry at three o'clock in
        the morning because your crappy error handling might
        jeopardize their entire career.
        How do you feel about that?
      - Dylan Beattie
      <!-- A null ref (or NaN, or undefined, or whatever) is "just" a nul ref,
           but to a person who relies on my code, it's the difference between
           achieving a goal, and potentially being fired. Or losing a chance
           at achieving their dream, in this instance -->

      # üí° Lack of Compassion is Baked in
      - "lusers" (TMRC, MIT, 1960s)
      - Flash forward to today, still happening
      - "banter"
      <!-- Back in the tail end of the '60s the Counter Cultural revolution was
           starting, and computers had started to leak out of labs and into the
           hands of some people outside of academia.
           Some folks (like Bob Albrecht of Dr. Dobb's fame) saw this as a great
           thing and would take computers around to local bars and handouts,
           allowing people to tinker with them.
           Over at MIT, though the world was a different place. The Model Railway
           Club (TMRC) quickly became the controllers of the new PDP devices, writing
           software, OSes, and libraries for anyone at the college to use.
           When users would ask for "low level" help (resetting passwords, etc.)
           the TMRC people would refer to them as "users with a silent l" because
           they were asking for things which were deemed "beneath" the skillset of
           the TMRC people.
           Looking down on people is a serious lack of empathy, sympathy and compassion.
           Genuinely, how many technology workers do you know who do this? I've worked
           with several in the past few years, and have had to walk away from well paid
           work because of some incidents like this.
           One example, direct quote from a developer I worked with, "she can't be a
           developer because she's a woman."
        -->

      # ‚ö†Ô∏èüí≠üìù On Words
        Words are like shrapnel, they cause a lot
        of hurt in tiny ways
      - Robin Ince
      <!-- I've lost the original source for this, but I was at a talk given
           by Robin Ince once, and he said this.
           Words really do have a power. They have a power to help and a power to
           hurt. Imagine that I say the following sentence:
             You're so good
           but put inflections of the different words.
             You're _so_ good
           vs
             _You're_ so good
           vs
             You're so _good_
           vs a flat reading:
             You're so good
           They all convey a different meaning entirely
      -->

      # ‚ö†Ô∏èüí≠üìù The User Matters
      "A project with no users is a pointless project" - Linus Torvalds
      "We should treat people as people; not as means to an end" - Immanuel Kant
      "There's no greys, only white that's got grubby...
       and sin, young man, is when you treat people as things."
      <!-- I know that Linus is almost never been a paragon of empathy, sympathy,
           or compassion. But he has a point here. Without the user, there's no
           reason for your software to exist.
           When we treat people as things, we take away their humanity and it's
           very tough to have compassion for someone when you don't treat them
           as a person.
           Remember the core teaching of the swahili phrase ubuntu: We are only
           people through other people.
           Also, I'm not a Kantian/Deontologist, but I think his point about
           not treating people as things applies regardless of where you are
           a Kantian or not.
      -->

      # ‚ö†Ô∏èüí≠üìù On Reported Bugs
        If we treat people inhumanely, we should never
        be surprised when they return the favour.
      - Scott Hershovitz (Nasty, Brutish, and Short)
      <!-- When someone reports a bug with our software, we should try to not
           see it as a personal attack; because it isn't one.
           Someone has found a gap in our collective understanding of what the
           software should do, and by finding that gap we have the ability to
           make the software objectively better.Better designed; better error
           handling; more fit for purpose.
           We should never respond with an attitude of "HOW DARE YOU TELL ME
           THAT MY SOFTWARE IS BAD!" Sure, it can hurt to have someone point
           out a flaw in something we have created; but remember, it's not
           their fault. (putting aside the idea of a malicious user, of course)
      -->

      # ‚ö†Ô∏èüí≠üìù On Listening
        All criticism, attack, insults, and judgements
        vanish when we focus attention on hearing the
        feelings behind a message
      - Marchall B. Rosenberg
      <!--
        Found this when reading Sarah Drasner's Engineering Management For The
        Rest Of Us. Sarah is quoting from Rosenberg's book "Nonviolent Communication"
        and we can apply this to when we see a bug or error report as a personal
        attack (which, of source, it isn't); by focussing on what the person is saying
        we can cut through the defensive feelings we may have, and get to what
        they are feeling, and why they are feeling it.
        Which will lead us directly to the "why" of what is being reported, which
        in turn we can look at with empathy once we know what the person is trying
        to achieve. We can then help them to achieve that thing.
        Remember: we're force multipliers for the people who use our software.
      -->

      # üìù Software is a Tool
      - Supposed to help
      - Should reduce complexity
      - Not get in the way
      - Not to cause pain
      - MUST be designed with compassion
      <!-- Someone is using your software to achieve a goal.
           That goal might be related to their work, their personal life, or
           a dream that they have. As Dylan pointed out earlier (and definitely
           go listen to that episode, it's fascinating), your software is stopping
           them from doing that thing, and it could be making them cry.
           We need to design our software with compassion for the user. Not just
           the UI/UX though; error handling, logging, friendly error messages (and
           not just "whoopsy doopsy floopsy :) ") with the user in mind.
           If I designed a chainsaw which only had the goal of cutting down trees
           and didn't take into consideration that people would use it, there'd be
           an awful lot of lumberjacks called "leftie"

      # üìù Open Discussion About the Software
      - Design
      - Execution
      - Without blame
      - With compassion for the user
      <!-- When bugs and error reports come in, you need to have an open, honest,
           and frank discussion about what happened. And this discussion needs to
           be without blame.
           Lots of companies claim to not have a blame culture, but very few do.
           Why no blame? Because blame brings about shame, and shame is one of the
           worst things that a team can foster. Bren√© Brown has spent her entire
           academic career looking into the affects of shame, and her results are
           staggering. Literally pick up any of her books and you'll be met with
           stats about how shame kills team cohesion and culture.
           "There is nothing productive about blame, and it often involves shaming
           someone or just being mean. If blame is a pattern in your culture, then
           shame needs to be addressed as an issue" (Bren√© Brown, Daring Greatly)
      -->

      # üìù Almost Never The User's Fault
      - You allowed them to do it
      - The *TEAM* who built it
      - The user doesn't know what the side effects are
      <!-- If I walk up to a pedestrian crossing, press the button, and get an
           electric shock, is it my fault? No.
           This thought experiment requires us to abandon the idea of a malicious
           user, intentionally tinkering with the crossing controls. There were
           also no signs saying, "do not touch. You will get an electric shock"
           The user was not to blame for the shock they got when the used to tool.
           The company who built the crossing or installed the controls are to
           blame.
           I just talked about how there's no blame, but that was on an individual
           level within the team. In this thought experiment,it's justified to blame
           the company NOT the individual engineer. The company should have employed
           a certain level of safety checking before allowing users to use that crossing

           explored the teachings of The Good Place (which I'm convinced is
           one of the greatest TV shows ever made), and started a journey (that
           I'm still on) of learning about philosophy.
           And some of the books you'll read will reinforce development related
           topics in places you might never have expected. Here are some
           examples of non-dev related books which are dev-related:
           - KonMari (the Mari Kondo book about tidying up) is about refactoring
