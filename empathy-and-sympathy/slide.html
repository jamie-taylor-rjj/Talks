      # A Quick Note
      Not aimed at our neurodivergent friends
      <!-- This talk does not attempt to make fun of or
           draw attention to those friends.
           Friends who are neurodivergent may have trouble
           with some of these topics. There are lots of
           way more intelligent people out there who can
           help our neurodivergent friends make sense of
           this topic, if they are having trouble with it.

      # Ancient Wisdom
        Wonderful teachings exist -
        The sword is unfathomable
      - Yamaoka Tesshu
      <!-- Do not think that
           This is all there is.
           More and more
           Wonderful teachings exist -
           The sword is unfathomable
      -->

      # What is Empthy?
      - Four qualities
      - Feeling *WITH* people
      <!--
        four qualities: perspective taking, no judgement, recognising emotion
        images: stuck-dark THEN not-alone.jpg
      -->

      # What Empathy is Not?
      - Pity
      - Sympathy
      - Knowing without caring
      <!--
           - pity is acknowledging someone's pain, but not doing anything
              else
           - sympathy is displaying pity and hoping that the person's
              suffering will go away; putting yourself in their shoes
      -->

      # Empathy is Caring
      - Caring
      - Understanding the struggle

      # What Compassion is
        // Seeking a solution
        compassion = (empathy or sympathy) and desire_to_relieve_suffering
      
      # Why Do We Need This?
      "Your code is making somebody cry at three o&apos;clock in the morning
      because your crappy error handling might jeopardize their entire career.
      How do you feel about that?" - Dylan Beatie

      # Lack of Compassion is (Almost) Baked in
      - "lusers" (MIT 1960s)
      <!--
        - countercultural revolution of the '60s
        - Computer Lib is released, if you've never read it then you should
        - people were discovering electronics, computers, and digital tech
        - the Cuban Missile crisis and WWII caused unprecedented amount of research
        - MIT was one of the hotbeds of computer research, adn where "lusers" comes from
        - TMRC invented the term
        - See: Friendly Orange Glow and Hackers (both are books)
      -->

      # The User Matters
      "A project with no users is a pointless project" - Linus Torvalds
      <!--
        - Granted, Linus isn't the best person to be quoting
        - But he has a very good point
        - The user is the person who is (directly or indirectly) paying you
        - Being all ivory towery will alienate your users, and you'll lose money or your job
      -->

      # Software is a Tool
      - Supposed to help
      - Should reduce complexity
      - Not get in the way
      - Not to cause pain
      - MUST be designed with compassion

      # Open Discussion About the Software
      - Design
      - Execution
      - Without blame
      - With compassion for the user

      # Almost Never The User's Fault
      - You allowed them to do it
      - The *TEAM* who built it
      - The user doesn't know what the side effects are
