      # 10 Things I Wish I Knew
      # Before Writing .NET On Linux
      <!-- Before we start, I've been using Linux-based OSs
           as my daily drivers for around 10 years, and I'm
           still learning.
           This is talk isn't going to answer every question
           that you have. However, I want to give you enough
           information that you can at least google things -->
      - Jamie Taylor

      # Do I NEED To Know Linux?
      Not at all
      Might be useful to know
      Might command a higher salary (YMMV)

      # First, Some Ancient Wisdom
      <!-- Do not think that
           This is all there is.
           More and more
           Wonderful teachings exist -
           The sword is unfathomable -->
        Wonderful teachings exist -
        The sword is unfathomable
      - Yamaoka Tesshu

      # What is Linux?
      <!-- 1) The point with this slide is to try and
           impress on the audience that Linux is
           everywhere ("my ally is the Force, and a powerful
           ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow.
           Its energy surrounds us, binds us")
           It's all of these things and none of them
           as Linux (or more correctly GNU Linux)
           is an OS kernel - like the NT kernel on Windows
           or XNU kernel on MacOS -->
      (Baby Don't Hurt Me, No More)
      That penguin thing
      Android
      All the IoT

      # So How Do I Get a Linux?
      <!-- 2) Here we're telling the audience that there
           are quite a few different "Linuxes" or distros.
           Each one has it's own lineage, and it might be
           an idea to have the Wiki page for the List of
           Linux Distros loaded in order to show this. -->
      ("one Linux, please")
      There are hundreds
      Most "famous" are Fedora, OpenSuse, REHL, Debian and Ubunutu
      Distros (short for distributions)

      # How Are They All Different?
      <!-- 3) There are a lot of differences in the many Linux
           distributions. Some differences are cosmetic, some
           are based on their package manager, and some are
           due to licensing.
           From an end-user's perspective, they look different
           but all act similarly.
           Some folks swear by rpm over apt, others thing that
           flatpack is the best.
           Each distro has it's own set of packages, positives
           and negatives.
           Some distros are not supported by .NET (CentOs 8,
           Debian 8, some versions of Ubuntu, etc.), and new
           versions of distros take time to get support, for
           example Fedora.
           See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux
           for the latest on .NET on Linux -->
      (how to sit on the fence)
      Tricky question
      They are all different, but mostly the same

      # It's Just Like Windows, Right?
      <!-- 4) Windows and Linux distros differ a lot, both in the
           look and feel (although Windows 11 looks a LOT like
           XFCE;, and Linux Mint looks a lot like Win 98; let's
           not mention ReactOS for now).
           From things as low level as line endings up to the
           security model, and through to how applications are
           installed, everything is different.
           The filesystem in Linux (and Unix) all lives under "/"
           and there are different places under than for different
           things. Some examples are:
           "/home" is your home directory (similar to your use area
           in Windows)
           "/bin" is where binaries go (like Program Files)
           "/dev" is where devices live, but they are accessed via
           either "/mnt" or "/media" for instance.
           wine is a backronym and means "Wine Is Not An Emulator",
           and is a compatibility layer which aims to run Windows
           apps on Linux distros. Have you heard of Proton or the
           Steam Deck? Proton uses Wine, and Steam Deak uses Proton. -->
      (visually, yes)
      No drive letters
      Different security model
      wine exists

      # apt, rpm, yum, flatpack, appimage, snap?
      <!-- 5) There are tonnes of different ways to package up and
           install applications on a Linux distro.
           Do we need to worry about this? As out .NET apps are
           all web, right? -->
      (and the beat goes on)
      No drive letters
      Different security model

      # docker Is Linux, Right?
      <!-- 6) Yup, and the wizardry that went on behind the scenes
           to get docker working on Windows is quite amazing.
           Essentially docker images are the steps required to install
           and run an app on a completely stripped down Linux install.
           Whilst docker isn't hard to get to grips with (per se),
           having background knowledge in Linux can help with the edge
           cases -->
      Absolutely
      Except for Windows containers
      But we don't talk about those

      # Do I Need To Know The CLI?
      <!-- 7) The majority of what you'll need to learn is who to use
           the package manager (maybe), the .NET SDK, and maybe a little
           docker (if you end up using it).
           But you can remove this dependency by using VS Code (free) or
           Rider (paid). Both are great, even though VS Code needs a bit
           of setup to get it working nicely. -->
      As a .NET dev? Maybe
      But not a huge amount
          dotnet --help
      VS Code and Rider are your friends

      # .NET Specific Advice?
      <!-- 8) Not everything in .NET works outside of Windows, but the
           amount of things which don't work is very small. Native GUIs
           (at the moment), Registry (there isn't one), and Windows auth
           are the only ones that I can think of.
           Native GUIs are coming in .NET Maui, but Linux WON'T be supported
           in the v1 time frame. (check episode 91 of the pod for a reason)
           tl;dr -> Android .NET Maui apps will be bootable on Linux, but
           Linux will not be a supported target platform.
           Paths in Linux (and Unix) use the forward slash separator (like
           the web), but paths on Windows use the backslash separator - best
           to just use Path.Join and .NET will figure it out.-->
      Not everything works
      But a *huge* amount does
      Watch you paths

      # Debugging
      <!-- 10) WinDBG (Windows Debugger) doesn't exist on Linux, but there's an
           extension for it called SOS which also works on the LLDB debugger.
           There are a lot of .NET global tools which you can use to help with
           debugging, too (dotnet-dump, dotnet-gcdump, dotnet-trace)
           SOS: https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/main/documentation/sos.md
           dotnet-dump: https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/main/documentation/dotnet-dump-instructions.md
           dotnet-gcdump: https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/main/documentation/dotnet-gcdump-instructions.md
           dotnet-trace: https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/main/documentation/dotnet-trace-instructions.md
           However, these are all more diagnostics than debugging. Depends on
           your definition of "debugging", I guess.
           Breakpoints still work in VS Code, but you do need to put a little more
           effort in before-hand. And Rider handles breakpoints pretty simply, too.
           Arch wiki as places to go first.-->
      Depends on what "debugging" means
      Used to be hard
      But it's getting way better

      # Support for Linux?
      <!-- 9) Not all Linuxes are free. Enterprises can look to REHL and similar
           for "enterprise level Linux" distributions. Some of these use the
           latest and greatest packages, whereas some use battle tested ones.
           Some enterprise Linuxes support things like hot-patching the kernel
           whilst in use (imagine not having to reboot to install updates).
           Most of the bigger names have _LOADS_ of support via documentation;
           as long as you're not doing something too off piste, someone will have
           already done it, and there will be documentation on it.
           I would recommend the Ubuntu tutorials, the Digital Ocean docs, and the
           Arch wiki as places to go first.-->
      Some distros are "enterprisey" and have paid support
      Most have free support via documentation and forums
      Ubuntu (and derivatives) are my favourite *because* of the support

      # How Do I Pick One?
      <!-- bonus) Picking a distro is about as personal as picking a car or the clothes
           you wear. Each distro has it's benefits and drawbacks, too.
           Personally, I would start with something from the Debian family. Ubuntu
           is a very user friendly starter distro. Pop OS is great, if you like gaming.
           There's nothing stopping you from diving into Arch or Kali Linux, but be
           aware that these are Linux in hard mode.
           The main difference between server and desktop distros is that desktop ones
           have a preconfigured GUI and are aimed at GUI users. Server distros tend to
           favour TUI (or terminal based) users.-->
      Long-lived ones are better
      Avoid Kali (unless you know what you're doing)
